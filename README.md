### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Nice to see you here! Here you will learn a pinch about me!
My name is MoisÃ©s, IÂ´m a brazilian Software Engineer who has started his journey as a developer not too long ago. 

Influenced by my father, a self taught senior developer and my personal superhero (yeah, that may be cliche but I donÂ´t care), I started learning development with JavaScript and Node.JS. 

After learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, my father set me on the path to learn Flutter. So when I started to learn and I was already involved with my fatherÂ´s company projects. That being said, I got to learn and practice on the go. Within a couple of years I've already taken the role of developing fully custom solutions by myself.

With 5 years of exeperience, I've taken full responsability for my father's company production.

Anyway, I have my dad to thank cause my particular path was unorthodox, since he was teaching me practical things and allowing me to contribute to his work, while teaching me the essential theoretical stuff.

I still have a looooot to learn, but my eagerness to do so is what drives me into that direction.
