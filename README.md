### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Nice to see you here! Here you will learn a pinch about me!
My name is MoisÃ©s, IÂ´m a brazilian Software Engineer who has started his journey as a developer not too long ago. 

Influenced by my father, a self taught senior developer and my personal superhero (yeah, that may be cliche but I donÂ´t care), I started learning development with JavaScript and Node.JS. When I was about to learn HTML, CSS and React my father set me on the path to learn Flutter. So when I started to learn and I was already involved with my fatherÂ´s projects so I got to learn on the go and got things pretty quickly. Within a year I was developing solutions that I myself could not believe.

Anyway, I have my dad to thank cause my particular path was unorthodox, since he was teaching me practical things and allowing me to contribute to his work, while teaching me the essential theoretical stuff.

I still have a looooot to learn, but my eagerness to do so is what drives me into that direction.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
A few projects for my company Dzign-e Sistemas e Tecnologia, and some personal projects

Flutter/Dart, Node.js, MySQL and MongoDB
